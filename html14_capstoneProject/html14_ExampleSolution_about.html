                <article>
                    <p>Mountain View Coffee Co. was founded in 2015 by coffee enthusiast Maria Chen and her
                        college friend David Rodriguez. What started as a small dream to share their love of
                        quality coffee with their community has grown into a beloved local gathering place.</p>

                    <p>Maria had spent two years traveling through Central America, learning about coffee
                        farming and roasting. David, an experienced barista, had worked at specialty coffee
                        shops across the country. Together, they decided to bring their passion home to
                        Anytown, Ohio.</p>

                    <p>Today, we serve hundreds of customers each week, from morning commuters to remote
                        workers to families looking for a cozy weekend spot. Our roastery is located just
                        blocks away, where we roast fresh batches of coffee daily.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>We believe that coffee is more than just a beverage—it's a connection between
                        farmers, roasters, baristas, and the community.</p>

                    <h3>Our Commitments:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quality:</strong> We source the finest beans from ethical suppliers and
                            roast them with care to bring out their unique flavors.</li>
                        <li><strong>Community:</strong> We create a welcoming space where people can gather,
                            work, create, and connect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We use compostable cups, source local pastries,
                            and support fair-trade practices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Excellence:</strong> Every cup of coffee is made with skill, attention,
                            and pride.</li>

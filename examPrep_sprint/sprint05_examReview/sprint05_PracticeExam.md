# ANSWER KEY & EXPLANATIONS

## BOOTSTRAP & RESPONSIVE DESIGN

**1. b) To center and pad the content with responsive margins**
- The container is the fundamental Bootstrap element that holds and centers content with responsive padding.

**2. b) 50% of the row width**
- `col-md-6` means 6 out of 12 columns, which equals 50% width. The "6" is not pixels or units—it's 6/12 of the row.

**3. a) 576 pixels**
- The sm breakpoint starts at 576px. Smaller screens are xs (no breakpoint specified). Remember: xs < 576px < sm, md (768px), lg (992px), xl (1200px), xxl (1400px).

**4. c) Framework**
- Framework is what Bootstrap IS, not a component OF Bootstrap. Navbar, Card, and Alert are all Bootstrap components.

**5. b) Applies level 3 margin (increases in predefined increments)**
- Bootstrap margins and padding use a scale system: m-0 (none), m-1 (0.25rem), m-2 (0.5rem), m-3 (1rem), m-4 (1.5rem), m-5 (3rem). Not pixels.

**6. a) `d-none d-md-block`**
- `d-none` hides on mobile (xs), `d-md-block` shows starting at md breakpoint (768px+). The second class overrides the first at that breakpoint.

## HTML FORMS

**7. b) The URL or script where form data is sent**
- The `action` attribute points to where the form submits. Example: `<form action="process.php">` sends to process.php.

**8. b) GET sends data in URL, POST sends in message body**
- This is the fundamental difference. GET is visible in URL (less secure, bookmarkable). POST is hidden (more secure, longer limits).

**9. c) Radio button**
- Radio buttons enforce single selection from a group. Checkboxes allow multiple. Select dropdowns also allow single but radio is traditional for grouped options.

**10. b) To group related form controls and provide a title for the group**
- `<fieldset>` groups related inputs, `<legend>` provides the title. Great for accessibility and organization.

**11. c) `for` (matching the input's `id`)**
- The label's `for` attribute must match the input's `id`. Example: `<label for="email">` paired with `<input id="email">`. This is crucial for accessibility.

**12. b) `type="email"`**
- type="email" provides built-in validation for email format and shows numeric keyboard on mobile. Better than plain text for this use case.

## SEO

**13. b) 50-60 characters**
- Google typically displays 50-60 characters of title tags in search results. Going over risks truncation.

**14. c) The summary text shown in search results**
- The meta description appears under the title in search results. Google may rewrite it but it's still important. Character limit: 150-160.

**15. b) One**
- Best practice is one H1 per page representing the main topic. Multiple H1s confuse screen readers and dilute SEO focus.

**16. c) To help screen readers and improve SEO when images don't load**
- Alt text serves two purposes: (1) Screen readers read it aloud for visually impaired users, (2) If image fails to load, alt text displays. Also helps SEO.

**17. b) Having a unique, descriptive title tag and meta description**
- These are foundational SEO elements that directly impact search results. Keyword stuffing, font tricks, and misleading titles violate search guidelines.

## ACCESSIBILITY

**18. b) Americans with Disabilities Act**
- ADA is the federal law requiring websites to be accessible to people with disabilities.

**19. c) 4.5:1**
- WCAG AA (industry standard) requires 4.5:1 contrast for normal text. AAA requires 7:1. Most websites should target AA.

**20. b) To provide additional semantic information to assistive technologies**
- ARIA = Accessible Rich Internet Applications. ARIA attributes help screen readers understand complex components like modals, dropdowns, and custom widgets.

**21. c) Using relative units like percentages**
- Percentages are actually good for accessibility (scalable, responsive). The other three are real barriers: missing alt text, missing labels, inaccessible buttons.

**22. b) By providing alt text for images and using a screen reader**
- Screen readers read alt text aloud. Images should be kept but must have proper alt descriptions. Text-only is not the solution.

## PROTOCOLS & DEPLOYMENT

**23. c) HTTPS encrypts data transmission with SSL/TLS**
- HTTPS = HTTP + SSL/TLS encryption. This protects sensitive data from being intercepted. Required for logins, payments, any sensitive data.

**24. b) Converts domain names to IP addresses**
- When you type example.com, DNS looks it up and returns the server's IP address (e.g., 192.0.2.1). It's like a phone book for the internet.

**25. b) Locally on your computer's repository**
- `git commit` saves changes to your LOCAL repo (.git folder). `git push` then uploads to GitHub. Commits aren't on the server until pushed.

**26. b) `username.github.io/project-name`**
- GitHub Pages format: `username.github.io` for user site (from repo named username.github.io), or `username.github.io/repo-name` for project sites.

## TESTING & DEPLOYMENT

**27. b) To verify HTML code conforms to standards**
- W3C HTML Validator (validator.w3.org) checks if your HTML is valid. W3C CSS Validator checks CSS. They help catch errors.

**28. c) Network tab**
- The Network tab shows HTTP requests, response status, file sizes, load times. Inspector shows HTML/CSS. Console shows errors/logs. Storage shows data.

**29. c) The developer's personal favorites feature**
- Wrong question. Should NOT be tested is "personal favorites" is not a standard feature. All others ARE important: browsers, screen sizes, accessibility, functionality.

**30. c) The requested resource/file was not found**
- 404 = Not Found. The server understood the request but can't find the file. Examples: broken link, deleted page, wrong filename.

## TROUBLESHOOTING METHODS

**31. b) Bottom-Up (start with the error, trace up)**
- You have a specific error in console. Start there and trace backward. This is textbook Bottom-Up troubleshooting.

**32. c) Follow the Path (trace data from form → handler → database)**
- Data flow issue: form → handler → database. Follow the path. Check: Does form submit? Does handler execute? Does database receive data? Follow data flow.

**33. d) Spot the Differences (use Git diff to see CSS changes)**
- Something just broke—perfect for Spot the Differences. `git diff` shows exactly what CSS changed. Inspector shows current styles vs expected.

**34. b) To pause JavaScript execution and inspect variables**
- Breakpoints (in the Sources tab) pause execution so you can inspect variable values. This helps debug JavaScript logic.

## BUSINESS, ETHICS & PROFESSIONAL SKILLS

**35. b) Check the licensing terms and either pay for license or use Creative Commons image instead**
- All creative work is copyright-protected by default. Must check permissions. Getty Images requires payment. Use Creative Commons (free, with attribution) or licensed sources instead.

**36. c) Lawsuits and settlements that can exceed $50,000**
- ADA lawsuits are real and increasing. Settlements commonly range $35,000-$50,000+. It's also the right thing to do ethically.

**37. b) Create a Design Brief to document requirements, scope, timeline, and stakeholders**
- A Design Brief prevents misunderstandings. It documents what's included, timeline, stakeholders, and success criteria before work starts.

**38. b) What is included AND explicitly what is NOT included**
- Scope clarity prevents scope creep. "Include redesigned homepage" and "Exclude mobile app development" are both important.

**39. c) Refuse—sensitive credentials should NEVER be shared in documents**
- Passwords, API keys, database credentials should NEVER go in shared docs, email, or untrusted places. Direct people to input themselves or use secure credential management.

**40. a) To show off your best work and capabilities to potential employers**
- Your portfolio is your visual resume. It shows employers what you can do. Quality projects matter more than quantity.

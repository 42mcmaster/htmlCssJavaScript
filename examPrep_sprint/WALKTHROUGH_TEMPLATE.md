## Practice Chunk 1: [Short Title — What Are We Doing?]

**What we're doing:** [One sentence explaining what this code chunk demonstrates.]

[For BUILD topics: "Create a new file called `filename.html` and type this code:"]
[For FIX topics: "Create a file called `filename.html` and type this STARTING code — it has problems we're going to fix:"]

```html
<!-- Your code goes here -->
<!-- Keep it under 25 lines -->
<!-- It must be complete and working (or intentionally broken for fix topics) -->
```

**What this does:** [Explain in plain English what the code does. Point out the important parts — which tags matter, which attributes are key, what connects to what. Be specific.]

[For FIX topics, add: **What's wrong here:** and then explain the problems before showing the fix.]
[For FIX topics, add the corrected code chunk:]

```html
<!-- Fixed/improved version goes here (for fix topics only) -->
```

**What to look for:** [Tell the class exactly what they should see in their browser. "You should see..." or "Try resizing your browser..." or "Click the button and..."]

## Teaching Notes

### Timing
- Lesson is dense but manageable in 4-5 class periods
- Can extend DIYTask to second week if needed
- Don't rush deployment - takes 1-2 min on GitHub
- Have students wait full 2-3 minutes after push

### Common Challenges
1. **Git authentication:** Use Personal Access Token, not password
2. **Absolute paths:** Emphasize relative paths ("style.css" not "C:/Users/...")
3. **404 errors:** Check repository is PUBLIC and Pages is enabled
4. **CSS won't load:** Check file paths are relative and files uploaded
5. **Impatience:** Remind students GitHub takes 1-2 minutes to deploy

### Differentiation

**For Struggling Students:**
- Provide filled template for testing checklist
- Pair with stronger student for deployment
- Simplify git to: `git add . → git commit → git push`
- Pre-load simple project to deploy

**For Advanced Students:**
- Add custom domain (DNS setup)
- Create README.md with documentation
- Add multiple pages and navigation
- Use Google Lighthouse for performance testing
- Create tutorial for others

### Assessment Flexibility
- Task 13a can be open-note (conceptual)
- Task 13b/13c are hands-on (must do themselves)
- DIYTask is capstone (replaces unit exam if desired)
- Gimkit/GoogleQuiz for formative feedback

---

## Extensions & Real-World Connections

1. **Show student work:** Display deployed sites on school website
2. **Guest speaker:** Invite web developer to discuss workflow
3. **Portfolio prep:** Students add GitHub Pages to portfolio
4. **Job readiness:** Discuss git in job interviews
5. **Certification prep:** Connect to CompTIA A+, AWS certifications
6. **Professional tools:** Mention Figma, Slack, Jira for teams

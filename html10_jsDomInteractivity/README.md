## How to Use These Materials

### For Instruction (30 minutes):
1. Present **html10_Slides.md** using Marp
2. Live code along with **html10_Walkthrough_Solutions.js**
3. Have students fill in **html10_Walkthrough.md**

### For Practice (45-60 minutes):
1. Students complete **html10a_Task.html** (DOM manipulation)
2. Students complete **html10b_Task.html** (events & validation)
3. Check against solutions provided

### For Mastery (Independent, 1-2 hours):
1. Students build **html10_DIYTask.md** (FAQ accordion + form)
2. Self-assess against rubric
3. Attempt stretch goals if time

### For Assessment:
- **Formative:** Use Gimkit or Google Quiz during instruction
- **Summative:** Unit3_EndOfUnit_GoogleQuiz after lesson 10

KEY CONCEPTS COVERED
================================================================================

DOM MANIPULATION (10a):
  ✓ Selecting elements (getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll)
  ✓ Changing content (textContent, innerHTML)
  ✓ Changing styles (style.property, camelCase)
  ✓ Visibility (display: none/block)

EVENTS & VALIDATION (10b):
  ✓ Event listeners (addEventListener)
  ✓ Event types (click, mouseover, mouseout, submit)
  ✓ Form validation (empty fields, email format)
  ✓ Error messages (show/hide with classList)
  ✓ Hover effects (JavaScript alternative to CSS)

INTERACTIVE PROJECTS:
  ✓ FAQ Accordion (click to expand/collapse)
  ✓ Contact Form with validation
  ✓ Real-time feedback
  ✓ Navigation hover effects

================================================================================
HOW TO USE EACH FILE TYPE
================================================================================

.md FILES (Markdown):
  - Open in any text editor or Markdown viewer
  - Use MARP for slides (Chrome extension or CLI)
  - Print or display for class reference

.html FILES:
  - Open directly in web browser
  - No server required
  - All assets (CSS/JS) are linked

.js FILES:
  - Paired with HTML files (external scripts)
  - Heavily commented for learning
  - Can be used standalone for code review

.csv FILES:
  - Import into Gimkit or Google Quiz
  - 27 questions per lesson quiz
  - 40 questions for end-of-unit assessment

================================================================================
TIPS FOR INSTRUCTORS
================================================================================

BEFORE TEACHING:
  1. Open each solution file in browser (test for errors)
  2. Read through JavaScript comments
  3. Familiarize yourself with the code flow
  4. Plan your pacing (instruction time varies by class)

DURING TEACHING:
  1. Use slides (html10_Slides.md) with projector
  2. Live code along with html10_Walkthrough_Solutions.js
  3. Have backup solutions ready (copy files to temp folder)
  4. Encourage students to read comments in code
  5. Use browser console (F12) for debugging demos

FOR STRUGGLING STUDENTS:
  1. Provide html10_StudyGuide.md as reference
  2. Have them trace through solutions line-by-line
  3. Ask them to explain what each line does
  4. Use simpler examples before DIY project

FOR ADVANCED STUDENTS:
  1. Challenge stretch goals in DIYTask.md
  2. Have them modify solutions (different colors, more questions, etc.)
  3. Encourage them to add features (localStorage, animations)
  4. Ask them to teach concepts to peers

ASSESSMENT STRATEGY:
  - Gimkit quiz: formative (during/after instruction)
  - Google Quiz: formative (review before assessment)
  - End-of-Unit Quiz: summative (after lesson 10)
  - DIY project: performance assessment

================================================================================
COMMON STUDENT MISTAKES
================================================================================

Covered in html10_StudyGuide.md:
  • Forgetting quotes around selectors
  • Using = instead of ===
  • Confusing innerHTML and textContent
  • Not using event.preventDefault()
  • Trying to access elements before page loads

Solutions are all commented to prevent these!

================================================================================
STANDARDS ALIGNMENT
================================================================================

ODE COMPETENCIES:
  • 6.2.7 - Hover and mouseover effects
  • 6.4.7 - Scripting to interact with data/forms
  • 6.3.1 - Scripting languages

This is the LAST lesson in Unit 3 - celebrate completion!

================================================================================
TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

Browser Requirements:
  - Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
  - ES6 JavaScript support
  - No frameworks or libraries (vanilla JS only)
  - Responsive design (works on mobile too)

Code Quality:
  - All code has inline comments
  - Valid HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ JavaScript
  - No console errors
  - Accessibility considered (labels, focus states)
  - Professional color scheme and styling

Compatibility:
  - Works offline (no CDN dependencies)
  - No file uploads needed
  - All assets self-contained
  - Cross-browser compatible

================================================================================
QUESTIONS OR ISSUES?
================================================================================

If files don't work:
  1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
  2. Verify all HTML/CSS/JS files are in same folder
  3. Try different browser
  4. Check file paths in HTML (should be relative: 'file.css')

Need to modify:
  - All files are plain text - edit with any text editor
  - Comments explain what each line does
  - CSS color scheme can be changed easily
  - JavaScript logic can be extended

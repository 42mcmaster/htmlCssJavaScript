# HTML 01 DIY Task: Build Your "About Me" Page

**Time Estimate:** 45 minutes
**What you'll submit:** One HTML file named `aboutMe.html`

- At least one `<h3>` subheading within a section
- At least 4 paragraphs of content total
- At least one use of the `<br>` tag to create a line break within a paragraph
- At least 3 comments throughout your code explaining sections or explaining your thinking

<p>What tech interests you? Why?</p>

<h2>Education & Goals</h2>
<p>What are you studying? What do you want to accomplish?</p>

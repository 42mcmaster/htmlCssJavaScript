## Lesson Flow

### Day 1: Script Tags & Variables (09a)
1. **Warm-up:** Show slides 1-5, discuss what JS does
2. **Walkthrough:** Lead students through console.log, variables, let vs. const
3. **Practice:** Students complete html09a_Task.html
4. **Check:** Review with html09a_Task_Solutions

### Day 2: Functions & Operators (09b)
1. **Review:** Slides 6-10 covering functions and template literals
2. **Walkthrough:** Lead students through function syntax and parameters
3. **Practice:** Students complete html09b_Task.html
4. **Check:** Review with html09b_Task_Solutions

### Days 3-4: DIY Project
1. **Project Brief:** Assign html09_DIYTask.md (Mad Libs generator)
2. **In-Class Work:** Students build variables, functions, and DOM display
3. **Review:** Show html09_DIYTask_Solutions.html and .js as reference
4. **Assessment:** Grading rubric included in DIYTask.md

### Day 5: Assessment
- **Gimkit:** Use html09_Gimkit.csv for fun review
- **Quiz:** Use html09_GoogleQuiz.csv for formal assessment

## Key Features

✓ **Scaffolded Learning:** Walkthrough → Task → DIY Project progression
✓ **Dual Format:** Each solution provided as inline (HTML) AND external (.js) file
✓ **Real-World Project:** Mad Libs engages students and teaches practical skills
✓ **Complete Comments:** Every code block has explanatory comments
✓ **camelCase Conventions:** All variables and functions use modern naming
✓ **Modern JavaScript:** Uses let/const (not var), template literals, proper DOM manipulation
✓ **ODE Alignment:** Covers competencies 6.3.1, 6.3.2, 6.3.3
✓ **Assessment Options:** Gimkit for engagement, Google Quiz for accountability

## Student Learning Outcomes

By completing this lesson, students will:
- Understand JavaScript runs in the browser (client-side)
- Create variables with let and const
- Recognize data types (string, number, boolean, undefined, null)
- Write and call functions with parameters
- Use template literals for string building
- Integrate JavaScript with HTML using script tags
- Use console.log() for debugging
- Write meaningful comments in code
- Build an interactive web page with DOM manipulation
- Apply programming concepts to a creative project

## Teaching Tips

1. **Console is Your Friend** — Always emphasize F12 Developer Tools for testing
2. **Avoid var** — Show it exists but teach let/const as modern approach
3. **Template Literals Rock** — Students love the readability; make this a focus
4. **Functions Enable Reuse** — Show how one function called multiple times saves time
5. **Mad Libs is Motivating** — Students love creating silly stories; use this momentum
6. **Pair Programming** — Consider partner coding for Tasks 09a and 09b

## File Sizes
- Total package: ~92KB (easily fits on USB or LMS)
- All files are plain text (Markdown, HTML, JavaScript, CSV)
- No external dependencies or media files

## Standards Alignment

| ODE Competency | Files That Address It |
|---|---|
| 6.3.1 Scripting languages in web development | html09_Slides.md, html09_StudyGuide.md, all Walkthrough files |
| 6.3.2 Insert client-side scripts | html09_Walkthrough.md (Part 7), all Task and DIYTask files |
| 6.3.3 Comments in scripts | All code files (HTML and JS) contain extensive comments |

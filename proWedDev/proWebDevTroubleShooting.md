# **Professional Web Development: Mini-Lesson 3**
# **Troubleshooting Methodologies**

## **Learning Objectives**
- Understand systematic approaches to problem-solving
- Apply top-down troubleshooting methodology
- Apply bottom-up troubleshooting methodology
- Use "follow the path" methodology for tracing issues
- Apply "spot the differences" methodology for comparison
- Select appropriate methodology for different problem types
- Document troubleshooting processes effectively

---

## **Why Troubleshooting Methodologies Matter**

**Random guessing wastes time and money.**

**With methodology:**
- Find bugs faster
- Fix problems correctly
- Document solutions
- Learn from issues
- Prevent future problems

**Without methodology:**
- Hours wasted on trial and error
- Same bugs reoccur
- Knowledge not shared
- Frustration increases
- Projects delayed

**Reality Check:** Professional developers spend 35-50% of their time debugging and troubleshooting. Having systematic approaches is critical.

---

## **The Scientific Method for Debugging**

All troubleshooting follows a scientific approach:

```
1. Observe the problem
   ↓
2. Form a hypothesis
   ↓
3. Test the hypothesis
   ↓
4. Analyze results
   ↓
5. Repeat or conclude
```

**Troubleshooting methodologies** are systematic ways to apply this process.

---

## **Four Core Methodologies**

### **Overview**

| Methodology | Best For | Approach |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Top-Down** | Large systems | Start at highest level, drill down |
| **Bottom-Up** | Component failures | Start at lowest level, build up |
| **Follow the Path** | Process/flow issues | Trace execution path |
| **Spot the Differences** | "It worked before" | Compare working vs. broken states |

**Key Insight:** The best methodology depends on the problem type.

---

## **1. Top-Down Troubleshooting**

### **What is Top-Down?**

**Top-down troubleshooting** starts at the highest level of the system and progressively narrows down to the specific problem.

**Think of it like:**
- Diagnosing a car: Engine runs → Check fuel system → Check fuel pump → Check pump motor
- Troubleshooting a website: Site won't load → Check server → Check configuration → Check specific file

---

### **When to Use Top-Down**

**Best for:**
- Large, complex systems
- When you don't know where the problem is
- Multiple components interact
- System-wide failures
- New or unfamiliar codebases

**Example scenarios:**
- "The website is down"
- "Users can't log in"
- "The contact form isn't working"
- "Pages load slowly"

---

### **Top-Down Process**

**Step 1: Start at the highest level**
Ask: "Is the entire system working?"

**Step 2: Divide the system in half**
Test which half has the problem.

**Step 3: Repeat**
Keep dividing until you isolate the issue.

**Step 4: Identify root cause**
Once isolated, find the exact problem.

**Step 5: Fix and verify**
Repair the issue and test the entire system.

---

### **Top-Down Example: Website Not Loading**

**Problem:** Users report the website isn't loading.

**Top-Down Process:**

```
Level 1: Is the server up?
├─ YES → Move to Level 2
└─ NO → Fix server issue ✓

Level 2: Is the web server responding?
├─ YES → Move to Level 3
└─ NO → Check web server config

Level 3: Are static files serving?
├─ YES → Move to Level 4
└─ NO → Check file permissions/paths

Level 4: Is the database responding?
├─ YES → Move to Level 5
└─ NO → Fix database connection ✓

Level 5: Are queries executing?
├─ YES → Check application logic
└─ NO → Fix SQL syntax ✓

Level 6: Is data displaying?
├─ YES → Issue found elsewhere
└─ NO → Fix data rendering ✓
```

**Result:** Database connection was down. Fixed connection string.

---

### **Top-Down Example: Form Not Submitting**

**Problem:** Contact form shows "success" but doesn't send email.

```
Level 1: Does form submit?
├─ Test: Fill out form and click Submit
└─ Result: Form submits ✓ (Not the issue)

Level 2: Does JavaScript validation run?
├─ Test: Check console for errors
└─ Result: No errors ✓ (Not the issue)

Level 3: Does the POST request send?
├─ Test: Open Network tab, check for request
└─ Result: Request sends ✓ (Not the issue)

Level 4: Does server receive data?
├─ Test: Add console.log to PHP script
└─ Result: Data received ✓ (Not the issue)

Level 5: Does email function execute?
├─ Test: Check if mail() function called
└─ Result: Function called ✓ (Not the issue)

Level 6: Is email actually sent?
├─ Test: Check email server logs
└─ Result: Email rejected by server ❌ (FOUND IT!)

Root Cause: SMTP credentials incorrect
Fix: Update email configuration
```

---

### **Top-Down Checklist**

When using top-down:
- [ ] Start with broadest question ("Is it working at all?")
- [ ] Use binary questions (yes/no answers)
- [ ] Eliminate half the possibilities each time
- [ ] Document each level tested
- [ ] Don't skip levels
- [ ] Verify fix at all levels

---

## **2. Bottom-Up Troubleshooting**

### **What is Bottom-Up?**

**Bottom-up troubleshooting** starts at the lowest, most basic level and works up to higher-level components.

**Think of it like:**
- Building blocks: Ensure foundation solid, then build up
- Debugging code: Verify variables, then functions, then interactions
- Hardware: Test power supply, then motherboard, then components

---

### **When to Use Bottom-Up**

**Best for:**
- Known component failures
- New features not working
- Isolated problems
- When you suspect a specific component
- Building/integrating systems

**Example scenarios:**
- "I added a new function and now nothing works"
- "The database query returns empty results"
- "CSS isn't applying to elements"
- "API integration isn't responding"

---

### **Bottom-Up Process**

**Step 1: Test the smallest component**
Verify the individual piece works in isolation.

**Step 2: Test the next layer up**
Verify that layer with the proven component.

**Step 3: Continue upward**
Keep adding proven components.

**Step 4: Find the failure point**
When something breaks, you've found the issue.

**Step 5: Fix and integrate**
Repair and continue building up.

---

### **Bottom-Up Example: Database Query Failing**

**Problem:** Query returns no results, should return 10 items.

**Bottom-Up Process:**

```
Level 1: Can we connect to database?
├─ Test: Basic connection script
├─ Result: ✓ Connection works

Level 2: Does table exist?
├─ Test: SHOW TABLES command
├─ Result: ✓ Table exists

Level 3: Does table have data?
├─ Test: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM menu_items
├─ Result: ✓ 45 rows in table

Level 4: Does basic SELECT work?
├─ Test: SELECT * FROM menu_items LIMIT 5
├─ Result: ✓ Returns 5 rows

Level 5: Does WHERE clause work?
├─ Test: SELECT * FROM menu_items WHERE category = 'appetizers'
├─ Result: ✓ Returns correct rows

Level 6: Does our specific query work?
├─ Test: SELECT * FROM menu_items WHERE category = 'Appetizers'
├─ Result: ❌ Returns 0 rows (FOUND IT!)

Root Cause: Case sensitivity - 'Appetizers' vs 'appetizers'
Fix: Change WHERE clause to WHERE LOWER(category) = 'appetizers'
```

---

### **Bottom-Up Example: CSS Not Applying**

**Problem:** New CSS rule not affecting element.

```
Level 1: Is CSS file loading?
├─ Test: Check Network tab for stylesheet
├─ Result: ✓ File loads

Level 2: Is CSS syntax valid?
├─ Test: Validate CSS with W3C validator
├─ Result: ✓ No syntax errors

Level 3: Does a simple rule work?
├─ Test: body { background: red; }
├─ Result: ✓ Background turns red

Level 4: Does class selector work?
├─ Test: .test { color: blue; }
├─ Result: ✓ Elements with .test class turn blue

Level 5: Does our specific selector work?
├─ Test: .menu-item { font-size: 20px; }
├─ Result: ❌ No change (FOUND IT!)

Level 6: Why doesn't .menu-item work?
├─ Test: Inspect element in DevTools
├─ Result: More specific rule overriding it
├─ Existing rule: .menu .menu-item { font-size: 16px; }

Root Cause: Specificity issue - existing rule more specific
Fix: Increase specificity or use !important (carefully)
```

---

### **Bottom-Up Checklist**

When using bottom-up:
- [ ] Verify the most basic components first
- [ ] Test in isolation when possible
- [ ] Build up layer by layer
- [ ] Only add proven components
- [ ] Note the failure point
- [ ] Fix the specific failing component

---

## **3. Follow the Path Methodology**

### **What is Follow the Path?**

**Follow the path** means tracing the execution flow from start to finish, step by step.

**Think of it like:**
- Following a delivery route
- Tracing a pipe for a leak
- Following breadcrumbs through code
- Tracking a user's journey

---

### **When to Use Follow the Path**

**Best for:**
- Process-based problems
- Data flow issues
- User journey problems
- API request/response issues
- Event handling bugs

**Example scenarios:**
- "Form submits but data doesn't save"
- "Payment processes but confirmation email doesn't send"
- "User clicks button but nothing happens"
- "API returns data but page doesn't update"

---

### **Follow the Path Process**

**Step 1: Identify the starting point**
Where does the process begin?

**Step 2: Identify the ending point**
Where should the process end?

**Step 3: Map the expected path**
What are all the steps in between?

**Step 4: Trace the actual path**
Follow execution with logging/debugging.

**Step 5: Find the break**
Where does actual path diverge from expected?

**Step 6: Fix the break**
Repair the discontinuity.

---

### **Follow the Path Example: Login Process**

**Problem:** Users click "Login" but stay on the same page.

**Expected Path:**
```
1. User enters credentials
2. User clicks "Login" button
3. JavaScript validates input
4. AJAX POST request sent to /api/login
5. Server validates credentials
6. Server creates session
7. Server returns success response
8. JavaScript receives response
9. Page redirects to dashboard
```

**Trace Actual Path:**
```
1. User enters credentials ✓
   └─ Logged: Input values present

2. User clicks "Login" button ✓
   └─ Logged: Click event fired

3. JavaScript validates input ✓
   └─ Logged: Validation passed

4. AJAX POST request sent ✓
   └─ Network tab: Request sent to /api/login

5. Server validates credentials ✓
   └─ Server log: Credentials valid

6. Server creates session ✓
   └─ Server log: Session ID created

7. Server returns success response ✓
   └─ Server log: Response sent with {success: true}

8. JavaScript receives response ❌
   └─ Console: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'success' of undefined
   └─ FOUND IT!

Root Cause: Response parsing error in JavaScript
Fix: Added response.json() before accessing response.success
```

---

### **Follow the Path Example: E-commerce Checkout**

**Problem:** Order confirmed but inventory not updated.

**Expected Path:**
```
1. User clicks "Place Order"
2. Payment processed
3. Order saved to database
4. Inventory decremented
5. Confirmation email sent
6. User redirected to thank you page
```

**Trace Actual Path:**
```
1. User clicks "Place Order" ✓
   └─ Event fired

2. Payment processed ✓
   └─ Payment API returned success

3. Order saved to database ✓
   └─ Order ID 12345 created

4. Inventory decremented ❌
   └─ Inventory function called but transaction failed
   └─ Error: Insufficient privileges for inventory table
   └─ FOUND IT!

Root Cause: Database user permissions missing for inventory table
Fix: Granted UPDATE permission on inventory table
```

---

### **Follow the Path Tools**

**Console Logging:**
```javascript
console.log('Step 1: Function called with:', arguments);
console.log('Step 2: Validation result:', isValid);
console.log('Step 3: API response:', response);
```

**Debugger Breakpoints:**
- Set breakpoint at each step
- Step through code line by line
- Inspect variables at each step

**Network Monitoring:**
- Watch AJAX/Fetch requests
- Check request/response data
- Verify correct endpoints called

**Server Logs:**
- Tail application logs
- Check error logs
- Verify database query logs

---

### **Follow the Path Checklist**

When following the path:
- [ ] Map expected path before tracing
- [ ] Add logging at each step
- [ ] Don't skip steps
- [ ] Verify data at each transition
- [ ] Note where path breaks
- [ ] Check error handling paths too

---

## **4. Spot the Differences Methodology**

### **What is Spot the Differences?**

**Spot the differences** involves comparing a working state to a broken state to identify what changed.

**Think of it like:**
- "Before and after" photos
- Comparing two versions of code
- A/B testing
- Diff tools in version control

---

### **When to Use Spot the Differences**

**Best for:**
- "It worked yesterday" problems
- After updates/changes
- Cross-browser issues
- Environment-specific bugs
- Regression testing

**Example scenarios:**
- "The site worked fine last week"
- "It works in Chrome but not Firefox"
- "Works on my machine but not production"
- "Worked before the update"

---

### **Spot the Differences Process**

**Step 1: Identify the working state**
When/where does it work correctly?

**Step 2: Identify the broken state**
When/where does it fail?

**Step 3: List all differences**
What's different between the states?

**Step 4: Test each difference**
Isolate and test each variable.

**Step 5: Find the cause**
Which difference causes the failure?

**Step 6: Fix the difference**
Align broken state with working state.

---

### **Spot the Differences Example: Cross-Browser Issue**

**Problem:** Layout perfect in Chrome, broken in Firefox.

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Chrome (Working) | Firefox (Broken) | Difference? |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| HTML | Same file | Same file | ❌ No |
| CSS | Same stylesheet | Same stylesheet | ❌ No |
| JavaScript | Executes | Executes | ❌ No |
| Flexbox | Renders correctly | Gaps between items | ✓ YES |
| Images | Load | Load | ❌ No |
| Fonts | Display | Display | ❌ No |

**Focus on Flexbox difference:**
```css
/* Current CSS */
.menu-grid {
    display: flex;
    gap: 20px;  /* ← Suspect this */
}
```

**Research:** 
- Chrome: Full support for `gap` in flexbox
- Firefox: Support added in version 63 (older versions don't support)

**Test:**
```css
/* Alternative approach */
.menu-grid {
    display: flex;
}

.menu-item {
    margin: 10px; /* Older fallback */
}
```

**Result:** Works in both browsers!

**Root Cause:** Using CSS `gap` property not supported in older Firefox
**Fix:** Use margin-based spacing for better compatibility

---

### **Spot the Differences Example: Production vs. Development**

**Problem:** Site works locally, fails in production.

**Comparison:**

| Variable | Development (Working) | Production (Broken) | Difference? |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| PHP Version | 8.1 | 7.4 | ✓ YES |
| Database | MySQL 8.0 | MySQL 5.7 | ✓ YES |
| Web Server | Apache 2.4 | Apache 2.4 | ❌ No |
| SSL | No | Yes | ✓ YES |
| File Permissions | 777 | 644 | ✓ YES |
| Error Reporting | On | Off | ✓ YES |

**Test differences:**

**Test 1: PHP Version**
```php
// Check if using PHP 8 features
// Match expression introduced in PHP 8.0
$result = match($value) {
    'A' => 1,
    'B' => 2
};
```
**Result:** Syntax error on PHP 7.4! ← FOUND IT!

**Root Cause:** Using PHP 8 syntax on PHP 7.4 server
**Fix Options:**
1. Upgrade production PHP to 8.1
2. Rewrite code for PHP 7.4 compatibility

---

### **Spot the Differences Example: "It Worked Yesterday"**

**Problem:** Form validation stopped working after update.

**Use Git to compare:**
```bash
# Show changes from yesterday
git diff HEAD@{1} contact-form.js

# Result shows:
- if (email.includes('@')) {
+ if (email.match('@')) {
```

**Test the difference:**
```javascript
// Old version (working)
if (email.includes('@')) {  // returns boolean
    // Valid email
}

// New version (broken)
if (email.match('@')) {  // returns array or null
    // Always truthy (even empty array is truthy!)
}
```

**Root Cause:** Changed `.includes()` to `.match()` incorrectly
**Fix:** Revert to `.includes()` or use `.match()` correctly:
```javascript
if (email.match(/@/)) {  // Correct: regex returns match or null
    // Valid email
}
```

---

### **Spot the Differences Tools**

**Version Control:**
```bash
# Git commands
git diff                    # Compare to last commit
git diff HEAD~1            # Compare to previous commit
git log -p filename        # Show change history
git blame filename         # See who changed each line
```

**Browser DevTools:**
- Compare computed styles
- Check Console errors
- Network tab differences
- Performance differences

**Database:**
```sql
-- Compare table structures
DESCRIBE table_name;

-- Compare data
SELECT * FROM users WHERE environment = 'dev';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE environment = 'prod';
```

**File Comparison:**
- WinMerge (Windows)
- Meld (Linux/Mac)
- VS Code built-in diff
- Beyond Compare

---

### **Spot the Differences Checklist**

When spotting differences:
- [ ] Clearly identify working and broken states
- [ ] List ALL differences, even small ones
- [ ] Test differences one at a time
- [ ] Document which difference causes failure
- [ ] Consider combinations of differences
- [ ] Use version control when available

---

## **Choosing the Right Methodology**

### **Decision Flow**

```
Start: You have a bug

Question 1: Do you know where the bug is?
├─ NO → Use TOP-DOWN
└─ YES → Go to Question 2

Question 2: Is it a single component/function?
├─ YES → Use BOTTOM-UP
└─ NO → Go to Question 3

Question 3: Is it a flow/process issue?
├─ YES → Use FOLLOW THE PATH
└─ NO → Go to Question 4

Question 4: Did it work before?
├─ YES → Use SPOT THE DIFFERENCES
└─ NO → Use TOP-DOWN (unknown issue)
```

---

### **Combined Approach**

**Often, you'll use multiple methodologies:**

**Example:** "Form worked last week, now broken"

1. **Start with Spot the Differences** (it worked before)
   - Identify what changed
   - Find: JavaScript library updated

2. **Switch to Follow the Path** (trace the process)
   - Follow form submission flow
   - Find: Validation function signature changed

3. **Use Bottom-Up** (fix the component)
   - Test old function signature
   - Test new function signature
   - Update our code to match new signature

---

## **Troubleshooting Documentation**

### **Why Document?**

**Benefits:**
- Future reference ("We fixed this before")
- Team knowledge sharing
- Training new developers
- Preventing recurrence
- Tracking patterns

---

### **Troubleshooting Report Template**

```markdown
# Troubleshooting Report

**Date:** July 20, 2025
**Reporter:** Jennifer Kim
**Issue ID:** BUG-042

## Problem Description
Contact form shows success message but emails not delivered.

## Impact
- Severity: High
- Users affected: All form users
- Business impact: Lost customer inquiries

## Investigation

**Methodology Used:** Follow the Path

**Timeline:**
- 2:00 PM: Issue reported by client
- 2:15 PM: Confirmed issue in production
- 2:30 PM: Began tracing execution path
- 3:00 PM: Identified root cause
- 3:30 PM: Deployed fix
- 4:00 PM: Verified resolution

**Path Traced:**

2. Client-side validation ✓
3. AJAX POST request ✓
4. Server receives data ✓
5. Server validation ✓
6. Email function called ✓
7. Email sent? ✗ (FAILED HERE)

**Tests Performed:**
- Checked SMTP credentials
- Verified mail server status
- Tested with different recipients
- Reviewed server logs

## Root Cause
SMTP server password changed during security audit but not 
updated in application configuration file.

## Resolution
Updated `/config/mail.php` with new SMTP credentials.

**Code Changed:**
```php
// Before
'password' => env('MAIL_PASSWORD', 'oldpassword'),

// After
'password' => env('MAIL_PASSWORD', 'newpassword123'),
```

## Verification
- Tested form submission
- Verified email received
- Checked with 5 different email addresses
- Monitored for 1 hour after fix

## Prevention
- Added SMTP credentials to password manager
- Created documentation for credential updates
- Added automated alert if email delivery fails
- Scheduled weekly email system health check

## Lessons Learned
- Need better process for credential updates across systems
- Should have caught this during security audit
- Consider implementing email queue with retry logic

## What Changed From the Old Curriculum

| Old (18 weeks) | New (10 weeks) | Why |
|----------------|----------------|-----|
| 5 HTML lessons + refresher | 4 HTML lessons | Consolidated — less overlap, tighter flow |
| 4 CSS lessons | 3 CSS lessons | Box model + layout combined, grid/flex combined |
| 8 JS lessons (js00-js07) | 2 JS lessons | Web Design course, not a JS course — basics + DOM only |
| 4 Bootstrap lessons | 1 Bootstrap lesson | Students only need grid + key components |
| CS Fundamentals lesson | Removed | Not a Strand 6 competency — cover elsewhere |
| Pro Web Dev (3 lessons) | Removed | Strand 2 content — cover in separate series |
| AI-Assisted Web Dev | Removed | Great content, but not an ODE competency — use as enrichment |
| Separate multimedia + SEO + hosting + testing lessons | Combined into html04, html12, html13 | Integrated into flow instead of standalone |
| Career Research Project | Removed | Strand 1 content — cover in separate series |
| Herb Society client project | Removed | Replaced by simpler capstone with clear requirements |

---

## Notes for Ryan

1. **The old JS content is excellent** — just too much for a Web Design course. Save js03-js07 for your Software Engineering class.
2. **The Pro Web Dev series is great** — use it in your separate Strand 2 lesson series, not here.
3. **AI-Assisted Web Dev** — consider using it as a bonus/enrichment activity during capstone week for fast finishers.
4. **The Herb Society project** — still a great option if you want to swap it in as the capstone client brief.
5. **Bootstrap is kept to one lesson** — students get the grid and key components, which is enough for responsive design. They don't need 4 lessons on it.
6. **Every lesson hits lab hard** — the slide decks are 10 slides max, walkthroughs are guided coding (not reading), and tasks are build-something exercises.

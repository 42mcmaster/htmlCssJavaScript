## Lesson Structure

### ðŸ“˜ Lesson 00: What is Programming?
**Prerequisites:** None - start here!  
**Time:** 45-60 minutes  
**File:** `js00.md`

**What students learn:**
- What a computer program is
- How computers execute instructions
- The difference between high-level and low-level languages
- What JavaScript is and why we use it
- How code executes from top to bottom
- The programming mindset (patience, precision, logic)

**Key concepts:**
- Programs are sets of instructions
- High-level languages are easier for humans
- JavaScript engine translates code to machine code
- Code runs sequentially
- Computers are fast but need specific instructions

**Tasks:** `js00Tasks.md`
- Algorithm writing exercise (making a sandwich)
- Code order predictions
- Vocabulary matching
- Real-world programming examples

### ðŸ“˜ Lesson 00 Part 2: Understanding JavaScript Syntax
**Prerequisites:** Complete Lesson 00  
**Time:** 60-75 minutes  
**File:** `js00-part2.md`

**What students learn:**
- What functions are (pre-written blocks of code)
- What objects are (containers for related functions/data)
- What methods are (functions that belong to objects)
- How to read JavaScript code
- Understanding syntax: parentheses, quotes, semicolons, dots
- Common syntax errors and how to avoid them

**Key concepts:**
- Functions like `alert()` hide complex code
- Objects like `document` and `console` contain methods
- Dot notation connects objects to methods
- Strings need quotes
- Parentheses call functions
- Understanding `alert()`, `console.log()`, and `document.write()`

**Tasks:** `js00-part2Tasks.md`
- Code anatomy labeling
- Function vs method identification
- Reading code out loud (translation to English)
- Spot the syntax errors
- Quote usage practice
- Browser console testing
- Building code examples

### ðŸ“˜ Lesson 01: Introduction to JavaScript (Original)
**Prerequisites:** Complete Lesson 00 and 00 Part 2  
**Time:** 60-75 minutes  
**File:** `js01.md`

**What students learn:**
- Three ways to add JavaScript to HTML
- Using alert(), console.log(), and document.write()
- Opening and using the browser console
- Writing comments
- Creating their first JavaScript programs

**Now students understand:**
- Why we use `<script>` tags (to tell the browser "this is JavaScript")
- What `document.write()` actually does (document object's write method)
- Why `alert('message')` works (calling the alert function)
- Why `console.log()` requires F12 (console is in developer tools)

**Tasks:** `js01Tasks.md`
- Guided first JavaScript page
- Console practice
- Multi-method output
- Comments challenge
- External JavaScript files
- Debug the code challenge
- Personal introduction page project

## Why This Structure Works

### The Problem
Students were jumping straight into using functions and methods without understanding:
- What a function is
- Why we use parentheses
- What `document` is (an object)
- What `.write()` means (a method)
- Why things are written the way they are

### The Solution
**Lesson 00:** Establishes that code is instructions, and high-level languages make it easier

**Lesson 00 Part 2:** Teaches how to READ code before writing it
- "Functions are pre-written code you can use"
- "Objects are containers; methods are their functions"
- "When you use `alert()`, tons of complex code runs automatically"

**Lesson 01:** Now they can write code and understand what they're doing
- They know `alert()` is calling a function
- They know `document.write()` is using the document object's write method
- They know `console.log()` is using the console object's log method

---

## Teaching Tips

### For Lesson 00:
- Emphasize that programming is problem-solving
- Use the sandwich exercise - it really drives home how specific instructions must be
- Encourage discussion about how they use programs daily
- Don't rush - these concepts are foundational

### For Lesson 00 Part 2:
- Have students practice reading code out loud
- Use analogies: functions = buttons on a remote, objects = containers
- Let them experiment in the browser console - it's safe and immediate
- Point out patterns repeatedly (object.method syntax appears everywhere)

### For Lesson 01:
- Students should now feel more confident because they understand what they're looking at
- Reinforce the vocabulary from 00 Part 2 as they code
- Praise them for understanding the "why" not just the "how"

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of these three lessons, students will be able to:

âœ… Explain what a program is and how computers execute code  
âœ… Describe the difference between high-level and low-level languages  
âœ… Define functions, objects, and methods  
âœ… Read simple JavaScript code and explain what it does  
âœ… Identify common syntax elements (quotes, parentheses, dots, semicolons)  
âœ… Write basic JavaScript using alert(), console.log(), and document.write()  
âœ… Add JavaScript to HTML in three different ways  
âœ… Use the browser console for testing and debugging  
âœ… Write code comments  
âœ… Recognize and fix common syntax errors

## Assessment Suggestions

### Formative Assessment (During Lessons):
- Check Task 2 predictions in js00Tasks - do they understand sequential execution?
- Review syntax error identification in js00-part2Tasks - can they spot mistakes?
- Observe console usage - are they comfortable with F12 and reading errors?

### Summative Assessment (After All Three Lessons):
**Suggested Project: "About Me" Interactive Page**

Students create an HTML page with external JavaScript that:
1. Shows an alert welcoming visitors (demonstrates: functions)
2. Uses document.write() to add their name as a heading (demonstrates: objects/methods)
3. Uses document.write() to add paragraphs about themselves (demonstrates: strings)
4. Logs messages to the console showing the page loaded (demonstrates: console use)
5. Includes comments explaining each section (demonstrates: documentation)

**Grading Rubric:**
- Correct HTML structure with external JS file (2 points)
- Proper use of alert() (1 point)
- Proper use of document.write() (2 points)
- Proper use of console.log() (1 point)
- Clear comments explaining code (2 points)
- No syntax errors, code runs correctly (2 points)

## Common Student Questions

**Q: "Why do we need to learn what functions are? Can't we just use them?"**  
A: Understanding functions helps you know when to use them, how to troubleshoot errors, and prepares you for writing your own functions later. Plus, when you see `Math.random()` or `Array.sort()`, you'll know what's happening!

**Q: "Is it really important to understand objects and methods now?"**  
A: Yes! Almost everything in JavaScript involves objects and methods. Understanding `object.method()` syntax now means every future example will make sense.

**Q: "Do I need to memorize all the syntax rules?"**  
A: No need to memorize! With practice, it becomes natural. Keep your reference guide handy and refer to it often.

**Q: "Why do we use the console so much?"**  
A: The console is your best friend as a developer. It shows errors, lets you test code immediately, and helps you debug. Professional developers use it constantly!

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Students Who Need More Support:
- Pair programming during tasks
- Extra time on syntax exercises
- Provide pre-written code to analyze before writing from scratch
- Use highlighters to color-code syntax elements
- Create physical flashcards for vocabulary

### For Advanced Students:
- Challenge them to explain concepts to peers
- Bonus tasks: explore additional methods (Math.floor, String.length)
- Research how JavaScript engines work internally
- Start thinking about when to use each output method appropriately

---

## Connection to Future Lessons

These foundational lessons set up success for:
- **Variables:** Students understand functions can store and use data
- **Operators:** Students can read math/logic operations
- **Conditionals:** Students understand sequential execution can branch
- **Loops:** Students see how instructions can repeat
- **Functions (writing):** Students already know what functions are and how to call them
- **DOM Manipulation:** Students understand objects/methods, making DOM methods natural

---

## Resources for Teachers

### Helpful Analogies:
- **Functions:** Buttons on a remote control (you press it, something complex happens)
- **Objects:** Toolboxes (contain related tools/methods)
- **Methods:** Tools in a toolbox (each does a specific job)
- **High-level languages:** Talking to a smart assistant vs. explaining every tiny step

### Common Mistakes to Watch For:
- Misspelling function/method names
- Forgetting quotes around strings
- Mismatched parentheses or quotes
- Using capital letters incorrectly (Alert vs alert)
- Forgetting semicolons (usually not a problem, but good habit)
- Not opening console to see console.log() output

### Extension Activities:
- Have students create a "JavaScript Dictionary" poster
- Code reading exercise: analyze professional website console output
- Pair students to create quiz questions about functions/objects
- "Explain to a 5-year-old" challenge for programming concepts

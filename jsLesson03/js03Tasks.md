## Task 1: GUIDED EXAMPLE - Grade Calculator

**Follow these steps to create a grade calculator.**

### Step 1: Create the HTML File
Create a file called `grade-calculator.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Grade Calculator</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            max-width: 500px;
            margin: 50px auto;
            padding: 20px;
            background-color: #f5f5f5;
        }
        .result {
            background-color: white;
            padding: 20px;
            border-radius: 8px;
            margin-top: 20px;
            box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
        }
        h1 {
            color: #333;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Grade Calculator</h1>
    <div class="result" id="output"></div>
    
    <script>
        // Test scores
        let test1 = 85;
        let test2 = 92;
        let test3 = 78;
        let test4 = 88;
        
        // Calculate total
        let total = test1 + test2 + test3 + test4;
        
        // Calculate average
        let average = total / 4;
        
        // Round to 1 decimal place
        let roundedAverage = average.toFixed(1);
        
        // Display results
        let output = `
            Test 1: ${test1}
            Test 2: ${test2}
            Test 3: ${test3}
            Test 4: ${test4}
            
            Total Points: ${total}
            Average: ${roundedAverage}
        `;
        
        document.getElementById('output').textContent = output;
        
        // Log to console
        console.log('Average grade:', roundedAverage);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: Test and Modify
1. Open the file in your browser
2. See the calculated results
3. Change the test scores to different values
4. Refresh and see the new calculation

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** The average should update correctly when you change the test scores.

3. Perform all five operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
4. Display each result on the page with a label
5. Also log each result to the console

### Expected Output on Page:
```
Addition: 10 + 5 = 15
Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5
Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50
Division: 10 / 5 = 2
Remainder: 10 % 5 = 0
```

**üí° Hint:** Create 5 different paragraph elements with ids, then populate them with results.

3. Calculate the subtotal (sum of all prices)
4. Calculate tax (8% of subtotal)
5. Calculate the total (subtotal + tax)
6. Display all the information formatted nicely on the page

### Variables you need:
```javascript
let item1Price = 29.99;
let item2Price = 15.50;

Total: $94.49
```

**üí° Hint:** Use `.toFixed(2)` to format prices to 2 decimal places.

---

## Task 4: Counter with Increment/Decrement

**Goal:** Practice using `++` and `--`.

### Instructions:
1. Create a file called `score-tracker.html`
2. Create a variable called `score` starting at 0
3. Display the starting score
4. Use `++` to increase the score 5 times (one at a time)
5. Display the score after each increase
6. Use `--` to decrease the score 2 times
7. Display the final score

### Expected Display:
```
Starting score: 0
After point 1: 1
After point 2: 2
After point 3: 3
After point 4: 4
After point 5: 5
After penalty 1: 4
After penalty 2: 3
Final Score: 3
```

## Task 5: Temperature Converter

**Goal:** Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

### Instructions:
1. Create a file called `temperature.html`
2. Create a variable for temperature in Celsius
3. Use the formula: `F = (C √ó 9/5) + 32`
4. Calculate and display both temperatures
5. Test with at least 3 different Celsius values

### Example:
- 0¬∞C = 32¬∞F
- 20¬∞C = 68¬∞F
- 100¬∞C = 212¬∞F

### Display Format:
```
Temperature Converter
---------------------
0¬∞C = 32¬∞F
20¬∞C = 68¬∞F
100¬∞C = 212¬∞F
```

**üí° Hint:** You can create multiple variables for different Celsius temperatures and convert each one.

## Task 6: Percentage Calculator

**Goal:** Calculate percentages and practice division.

### Instructions:
1. Create a file called `percentages.html`
2. Create these scenarios:
   - You scored 42 out of 50 on a test - what percentage?
   - You answered 18 out of 20 questions correctly - what percentage?
   - You completed 75 out of 100 tasks - what percentage?

3. Display each calculation with the formula and result

### Formula:
```javascript
percentage = (score / maxScore) * 100
```

### Expected Output:
```
Test Score: 42/50 = 84%
Quiz Score: 18/20 = 90%
Tasks Completed: 75/100 = 75%
```

**üí° Hint:** Use `.toFixed(0)` or `.toFixed(1)` for clean percentage displays.

3. Calculate:
   - Tip amount
   - Total with tip
   - Amount per person

4. Display all calculations nicely formatted

### Example Variables:
```javascript
let billAmount = 125.50;

## Tips for Success
1. **Test your math manually first** - Use a calculator to verify
2. **Use parentheses** - Make order of operations clear
3. **Format currency properly** - Always use `.toFixed(2)` for money
4. **Log values** - Check your calculations in the console
5. **One step at a time** - Build calculations gradually

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
‚ùå Forgetting order of operations
‚úÖ Use parentheses: `(a + b) / 2`

‚ùå Not rounding decimals
‚úÖ Use `.toFixed(2)` for money

‚ùå Dividing by zero (causes Infinity)
‚úÖ Check your divisor is not zero

‚ùå Confusing `=` with `==`
‚úÖ `=` assigns, `==` compares (we'll learn this soon)
